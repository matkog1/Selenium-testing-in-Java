Selenium Automation Tests in Java
Welcome to my Selenium Automation Testing project! This repository showcases my learning journey with Selenium using Java, following the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to create maintainable and reusable automation scripts.

 About the Project
This project is part of my learning process with the Selenium automation testing course by Rex Jones.

ðŸ“‹ Key Learnings:
Page Object Model (POM): Organize the code by separating UI elements and actions for cleaner, more maintainable automation scripts.
Web Element Interactions: Automate tasks like clicking buttons, filling forms, handling checkboxes, and selecting dropdowns.
Handling Frames, Alerts, and Windows: Learn to switch between different frames, alerts, and windows during testing.
Synchronization: Understand different wait mechanisms (explicit, implicit, fluent) to handle timing issues in automation.
Mouse and Keyboard Events: Simulate user interactions such as scrolling, mouse hovering, and keyboard input.
